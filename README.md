# Master Thesis Project

This project is part of my master thesis in the fields of web privacy, data science, and machine learning.
The purpose of this project is to develop several machine learning models using HTTP(S) response headers and related 
meta-data. It involves the following steps: (i) data collection, (ii) data exploration, (iii) feature engineering, (iv) 
training and testing of ML models, (v) hyper-parameter optimization, and (vi) model deployment. 
In addition, MLOps practices are partly implemented, e.g., to track the development of the models.
